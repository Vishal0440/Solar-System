      <p>
        Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to
        it by gravity- the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
        Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens of moons; and
        millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. Beyond our own solar
        system, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other
        stars in the Milky Way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond our own solar system, there are more planets than stars in the
        night sky. So far, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems
        orbiting other stars in the Milky Way, with more planets being found.
        Most of the hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy are thought to
        have planets of their own, and the Milky Way is but one of perhaps 100
        billion galaxies in the universe. The order and arrangement of the
        planets and other bodies in our solar system is due to the way the solar
        system formed. Nearest to the Sun, only rocky material could withstand
        the heat when the solar system was young. For this reason, the first
        four planets – Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars – are terrestrial
        planets. They are all small with solid, rocky surfaces. Meanwhile,
        materials we are used to seeing as ice, liquid, or gas settled in the
        outer regions of the young solar system. Gravity pulled these materials
        together, and that is where we find gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, and
        the ice giants Uranus and Neptune.

        <p>
          Mercury (0.307–0.588 AU (45.9–88.0 million km; 28.5–54.7 million mi)
          from the Sun[89]) is the closest planet to the Sun. The smallest
          planet in the Solar System (0.055 MEarth), Mercury has no natural
          satellites. The dominant geological features are impact craters or
          basins with ejecta blankets, the remains of early volcanic activity
          including magma flows, and lobed ridges or rupees that were probably
          produced by a period of contraction early in the planet's history.[90]
          Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere consists of solar-wind particles
          trapped by Mercury's magnetic field, as well as atoms blasted off its
          surface by the solar wind.[91][92] Its relatively large iron core and
          thin mantle have not yet been adequately explained. Hypotheses include
          that its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact, or that it
          was prevented from fully accreting by the young Sun's energy.[93][94]
          There have been searches for "Vulcanites", asteroids in stable orbits
          between Mercury and the Sun, but none have been discovered.[95][96]<a

        <p>
          Venus (0.718–0.728 AU (107.4–108.9 million km; 66.7–67.7 million mi)
          from the Sun[89]) is close in size to Earth (0.815 MEarth) and, like
          Earth, has a thick silicate mantle around an iron core, a substantial
          atmosphere, and evidence of internal geological activity. It is much
          drier than Earth, and its atmosphere is ninety times as dense. Venus
          has no natural satellites. It is the hottest planet, with surface
          temperatures over 400 °C (752 °F), mainly due to the amount of
          greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.[97] The planet has no magnetic
          field that would prevent depletion of its substantial atmosphere,
          which suggests that its atmosphere is being replenished by volcanic
          eruptions.[98] A relatively young planetary surface displays extensive
          evidence of volcanic activity, but is devoid of plate tectonics. It
          may undergo resurfacing episodes on a time scale of 700 million
          years.[99]<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System"

          Earth (0.983–1.017 AU (147.1–152.1 million km; 91.4–94.5 million mi)
          from the Sun) is the largest and densest of the inner planets, the
          only one known to have current geological activity, and the only place
          where life is known to exist.[100] Its liquid hydrosphere is unique
          among the terrestrial planets, and it is the only planet where plate
          tectonics has been observed.[101] Earth's atmosphere is radically
          different from those of the other planets, having been altered by the
          presence of life to contain 21% free oxygen.[102][103] The planetary
          magnetosphere shields the surface from solar and cosmic radiation,
          limiting atmospheric stripping and maintaining habitability.[104] It
          has one natural satellite, the Moon, the only large satellite of a
          terrestrial planet in the Solar System.<a

          Mars (1.382–1.666 AU (206.7–249.2 million km; 128.5–154.9 million mi)
          from the Sun) is smaller than Earth and Venus (0.107 MEarth). It has
          an atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide with a surface pressure of 6.1
          millibars (0.088 psi; 0.18 inHg); roughly 0.6% of that of Earth but
          sufficient to support weather phenomena.[105] Its surface, peppered
          with volcanoes, such as Olympus Mons, and rift valleys, such as Valley
          mariner's, shows geological activity that may have persisted until as
          recently as 2 million years ago.[106] Its red color comes from iron
          oxide (rust) in its soil.[107] Mars has two tiny natural satellites
          (Deimos and Phobos) thought to be either captured asteroids,[108] or
          ejected debris from a massive impact early in Mars's history.[109]<a

        <p>
          Jupiter (4.951–5.457 AU (740.7–816.4 million km; 460.2–507.3 million
          mi) from the Sun[89]), at 318 MEarth, is 2.5 times the mass of all the
          other planets put together. It is composed largely of hydrogen and
          helium. Jupiter's strong internal heat creates semi-permanent features
          in its atmosphere, such as cloud bands and the Great Red Spot. The
          planet possesses a 4.2–14 Gauss strength magnetosphere that spans
          22–29 million km, making it, in certain respects, the largest object
          in the Solar System.[130] Jupiter has 80 known satellites. The four
          largest, Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa, are called the Galilean
          moons: they show similarities to the terrestrial planets, such as
          volcanism and internal heating.[131] Ganymede, the largest satellite
          in the Solar System, is larger than Mercury; Callisto is almost as
          large.[132]<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System"

          mi) from the Sun[89]), distinguished by its extensive ring system, has
          several similarities to Jupiter, such as its atmospheric composition
          and magnetosphere. Although Saturn has 60% of Jupiter's volume, it is
          less than a third as massive, at 95 MEarth. Saturn is the only planet
          of the Solar System that is less dense than water. The rings of Saturn
          are made up of small ice and rock particles.[133] Saturn has 83
          confirmed satellites composed largely of ice. Two of these, Titan and
          Enceladus, show signs of geological activity;[134] they, as well as
          five other Saturnian moons (Iapetus, Rhea, Dione, Tethys, and Mimas),
          are large enough to be round. Titan, the second-largest moon in the
          Solar System, is bigger than Mercury and the only satellite in the
          Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.[135][136]<a

          mi) from the Sun[89]), at 14 MEarth, has the lowest mass of the outer
          planets. Uniquely among the planets, it orbits the Sun on its side;
          its axial tilt is over ninety degrees to the ecliptic. This gives the
          planet extreme seasonal variation as each pole points toward and then
          away from the Sun.[137] It has a much colder core than the other giant
          planets and radiates very little heat into space.[138] As a
          consequence, it has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar
          System.[139] Uranus has 27 known satellites, the largest ones being
          Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda.[140] Like the other
          giant planets, it possesses a ring system and magnetosphere.[141]<a

          mi) from the Sun[89]), though slightly smaller than Uranus, is more
          massive (17 MEarth) and hence more dense. It radiates more internal
          heat than Uranus, but not as much as Jupiter or Saturn.[142] Neptune
          has 14 known satellites. The largest, Triton, is geologically active,
          with geysers of liquid nitrogen.[143] Triton is the only large
          satellite with a retrograde orbit, which indicates that it did not
          form with Neptune, but was probably captured from the Kaiser
          belt.[144] Neptune is accompanied in its orbit by several minor
          planets, termed Neptune trojans, that either lead or trail the planet
          by about one-sixth of the way around the Sun, positions known as
          Lagrange points.[145]<a
